1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Answer:
The DriverPass project entailed developing a comprehensive system for our client, DriverPass, a company dedicated to supporting students’ preparation for driving tests. The client sought a system capable of delivering online practice exams, scheduling on-the-road driving lessons, and monitoring student progress. The system was required to accommodate various user types, including customers (students), administrators, and IT staff, equipping them with the necessary tools to manage their respective activities effectively.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I was good at understanding what the client needed and turning it into a straightforward system design. I made sure to sort out all the different requirements, both functional and non-functional. I also drew up a use case diagram in UML that showed how the system's users interacted with its functions, which gave us a solid development plan.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise my work, I would improve the detailed documentation of the system's non-functional requirements. Although these were addressed, I believe there's room to expand and include more specific performance, security, and scalability metrics. This enhancement would offer a more comprehensive framework for evaluating the system during development and ensuring it meets all expected standards.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's requirements through a meticulous analysis of the interview transcripts, aligning the system's features with the specific requests articulated by the client. By prioritizing the users' objectives—students, administrators, and IT personnel—I ensured the system's design was oriented toward user satisfaction. It is imperative to factor in the user's requisites during the design phase, as the efficacy of a system is contingent upon its usability and ability to support the users' operations. A system that caters to user needs is more likely to be embraced and advantageous for the organization.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My software design approach commences with a comprehensive understanding of the client's requirements. This involves creating UML diagrams, developing use case scenarios, and defining clear functional and non-functional requirements. As we move forward, I plan to integrate more iterative design strategies, such as Agile methodologies, to enhance the system design based on ongoing user feedback continuously. Additionally, regular validation of the design with the client will be ensured to maintain alignment with their expectations throughout development.
